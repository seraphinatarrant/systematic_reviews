# Branch Naming Conventions
* `master` is always stable, functional, and must pass tests
* `feature/[thing]` is for new functionality
* `refactor/[thing]` is for refactors
* be somewhat descriptive about your branch names. No need to delete branches after merges if you plan to use them later, but if they're dead then delete them.
* branches should not be merged into `master` or any other collaborative branch without initiating a pull request and getting sign off from another engineer.
