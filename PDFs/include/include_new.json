Accordingly, 31 (4.5%) bovine and 2 \u2026",

Mastitis was investigated by examining 80 cows (320 udder quarters) using California mastitis test (CMT) and somatic cell count (SCC). The prevalence of brucellosis was assessed by sampling 177 cattle in Awassa and its peri\u2010urban areas using serological methods. Logistic \u2026",
